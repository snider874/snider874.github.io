Memory Match Game, Scott Snider, Principles of System Design, CSC272
 

Individual Project Title: Memory Match Game App

 
Individual Project Objectives:
The Memory Match game will be a windows form application that lets the player choose and  reveal one image from 12 squares and then they must pick another square to match the same image. If the second choice matches the first, both squares will remain visible, if not they will turn back to blank squares and the player picks again until are images are matched correctly.


Project Team members: (Customers, Developers and Users)
Customers: Windows PC owners
Developers: Student(s) Scott Snider
Users: Windows PC consumers


Individual Project Deliverables: 
Functional Requirements:
1.	The game will be a windows form application and can be played by anyone who has access to a computer with windows.
2.	This game can be accessed by all users on Windows.


Project Supporting Resources: 
Database creation: The creation of the game requires Visual Studio
Risks and Constraints: 
The game will be simple and may not be the most entertaining thing to play on pc.

1.	Introduction/Project Summary

1.1	Objectives

To create a match game in Visual Studio using C# programming language

1.2	Overview (Project Title, Team members, Customer Name)

Memory Match Game, Scott Snider

There will be 12 boxes, where six different sets of symbols will be randomly set behind squares. The player will be allowed to click two boxes to reveal the picture behind it, if the pictures or symbols match, they will remain visible, if not both will turn back. The play will continue to match symbols until all 12 pictures are show and the player will then get a message that tells them they’ve match all symbols, and the game will close.


2.	System Description

2.1	System Requirements
. External Interface Requirements
a. User Interfaces
A computer mouse is all that is required to play the game.
b. Software Interfaces
GUI – Visual Studio uses a graphical user interface to display the memory match game.
Functional Requirements
•	Player uses left mouse button to select squares
•	First square remains visible until second square is selected
•	Matching graphics remain visible throughout game
•	Nonmatching graphics remain visible for 2 seconds before they disappear
Non-Functional Requirements
•	Game must allow player to select any two squares 
•	No time limit on choosing a square
•	Notify player when all graphics are matched

2.2	System Diagrams

 

2.3	Economical, technical and time and constraints
•	Number of players
•	Screen size/resolution
Memory match game is only designed to run in Visual Studio.
a.	Assumptions and Dependencies

•	Visual Studio
•	64-bit operating system

•	Screen ratio and resolution (not intended for full screen mode)
•	Only compatible in Visual Studio


3.	Hardware Detailed Implementation (What hardware equipment is needed to be used by your project)

A computer mouse is all that’s required to play the game

4.	Software Detailed Implementation (What other software is needed to be used by your project)

Visual Studio is required to play the game

5.	Test/Evaluation Experimental Procedure and Analysis of Results (How your project works include test images/diagrams)


6.	Societal impact of project including legal and ethical considerations (What benefits your project has to individuals or any group of people. Does it have any legal or ethical impacts to the society?


The game is intended to be played for leisure. There are no legal or ethical impacts to the society.

7.	Conclusions (What hardware equipment is needed to be used by your project)

The game is very basic and runs in Visual Studio. The player only needs a computer mouse to play the game.

8.	Recommendations for Future Work (What other things that can be added later to update the project)

In the future, multiple players could be added to play against each other to keep score. Also, a timer could be added to keep track of the fastest time, or the game could even end in a certain amount of time.

9.	Appendices:


9.1 Customer Contact Information (Who could be customers to the final software product of your project)

Customers could be other I.T. students or anyone who enjoys playing around with games created in Visual Studios.

9.2 Software installation instructions (How is the final software product of your project delivered to the users and installed)

The final C# code for this game could be given to students who are learning to use Visual Studio
